# **Scissors, Paper, Stone Game**  

This is my first project: **Scissors, Paper, Stone** â€” a fun game where you play against the computer! The outcome is based on the choices made by you and the computer.

---

## **How the Game Works**  
- Both you and the computer will make a choice: **Scissors**, **Paper**, or **Stone**.  
- The winner is determined by these rules:  
  1. **Scissors** beats **Paper** (Scissors cuts Paper).  
  2. **Paper** beats **Stone** (Paper wraps Stone).  
  3. **Stone** beats **Scissors** (Stone smashes Scissors).  
- If both choose the same option, it's a tie!

## **Features**  
1. **Visual Feedback**:  
   To enhance the experience, Iâ€™ve added colors to indicate the result of each round:  
   - **Green**: For a win.  
   - **Red**: For a loss.  
   - **Yellow**: For a draw.  

2. **Final Results**:  
   After playing multiple rounds, the game displays the **final results** and the **final points** earned by both you and the computer.
